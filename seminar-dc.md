#### Semi-orthogonal decompositions

The goal is to discuss recent developments in derived categories and related things. I will start with some surveys on semiorthogonal decompositions.

#### Stability conditions and geometry of Fano threefolds

This talk is an introduction to the recent applications of stability conditions in the geometry of Fano threefold. The first part will focus on the properties of classical moduli spaces, such as moduli spaces of sheaves and Hilbert schemes. I will talk about the applications of stability conditions in proving some smoothness and irreducibility results. Then I will explain the birational categorical Torelli theorem for Gushel-Mukai threefolds. If the time is permitted, I will talk about the Brill-Neother reconstruction of Fano threefolds. This talk is based on a series of joint work with Augustinas Jacovskis, Xun Lin, and Shizhuo Zhang.
